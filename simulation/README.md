# SIMULATION

Simulation models execution of an application on a target edge platform. It is useful to find potential problems in the application before the application is executed at the edge. Currently, we only support simulation of applications, represented as CSDF MoC. Every simulation delivers traces: special objects that contain informaion regarging use of platform resources (processors and memory) during the application execution.
